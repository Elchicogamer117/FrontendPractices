# The Web apps that you need test
These practices were made without any framework, the objective was improve the bases of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You can see the results [clicking here](https://elchicogamer117.github.io/FrontendPractices/)
## Way of working
A similar methodology was followed in each practice:
- First step: Define formulas
- Second step: Implement formulas in JavaScript
- Third step: Create functions
- Fourth step: Integrate JS with HTML
- Fifth step: Add style with CSS
For the last step figma was used to design the interface base.

## Practice 1: Geometric forms - GForms 📏
Do you need to confirm the area and/or perimeter of a basic form? 

This is your web app, you can choose between a square, a triangle, or a circle 😃

## Practice 2: Prices and discounts – How much pay? 🧮
Do you find a great offer and you want to know how much you’ll pay in the end? 

Use this simple calculator to know it 🤑

## Practice 3: Mean, median and mode - MeMeMo 📊
Statistics homework? 

This is a great tool to appreciate the behavior of a number list before different statistics 🎓

## Practice 4: Salary analysis 📉
Don't you know why is important to use different types of averages?

This web app allows you to see the importance of use the correct formula for determinate the average salary of a hypothetical city, adding new citizens with new salaries and watching how it affect each average 💸

## Foreseeable evolution 
As future work, we plan to do the following:
- Implement DOM manipulation methods to improve user experience
- Make a more complete salary analysis, including graphs and additional functions such as eliminating citizens.
